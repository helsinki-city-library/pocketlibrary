Pocket Library
==============

Pocket Library is a new kind of a service for library patrons. It runs on
modern iPhone and Android smartphones.

The service expands the traditional notion of checking out materials, making it
possible for library users to check out books and other items directly from other
users anywhere.

To be more generally useful as a library users personal information assistant, it also
has the ability to manage the users' loans and explore the library catalog.
